            \textbf{Combinatorics} is a branch of mathematics devoted to counting and colouring
            things in while respecting certain rules, and \textbf{Combinatorial Optimisation} is
            about finding the ``best'' way to do this. Some important real-world problems can be
            expressed as combinatorial optimisation problems, which makes them easier to model and
            solve using computers. Our research investigates how we can \textbf{exploit parallelism}
            present in today's multi-core processors to speed up the solving process, or to allow us
            to tackle larger or more complicated problems in the time we have.

Suppose we need to \textbf{schedule a day's meetings}. If a person needs to attend both meeting 3
and meeting 6, then these two meetings cannot be held at the same time. We can model this as a graph
problem: we draw a circle for each meeting, and put a line between two circles if these two meetings
must occur at different times. We then want to colour in these circles, giving adjacent circles
different colours, and using as few colours as possible. By treating different colours as different
time slots, colouring in the graph gives us an optimal meeting schedule.

\medskip

We can handle richer constraints: we might have a limit on how many circles any colour can be used
in (if we only have a \textbf{limited number of meeting rooms}), or we might want each colour to be
used on the same number of circles (for a \textbf{balanced workload}).

\medskip

More generally, graph colouring tells us how to use \textbf{as few resources as possible},
respecting conflicts. Industrial uses include call centre staff allocation, scheduling jobs on
machinery, radio bandwidth allocation, and reducing the impact of vehicle maintenance.

    A \textbf{clique} can be thought of as a group of people, where everyone in the group knows
    everyone else in the group.  Finding cliques lets us select \textbf{as much of a resource as
    possible}, respecting compatibility rules. Clique-finding algorithms have been used to improve
    the reliability of communications and networking protocols, for
    verifying electronic circuits, for social media analysis, for targeted advertising, and for controlling flying robots.

    Many real-world phenomena, such as social networks, transport routes, financial transactions,
    and chemical molecules, can be described using graphs. We may wish to \textbf{find interesting
    structures} inside these graphs. The subgraph isomorphism problem is to find a small ``pattern''
    graph in a big ``target'' graph. This is useful in drug design, in fraud detection, and in fault
    diagnosis.

    \medskip

    We can also \textbf{compare two graphs}. We do this via the maximum common subgraph problem,
    which is to find the largest subgraph common to two bigger graphs. This is useful in computer
    vision, database searches, and biochemistry.

\block{Research Area: Practical Techniques for Solving Hard Problems in Parallel}{

    Combinatorial optimization is, in general, a \textbf{hard problem} (like the famous
    \textbf{travelling salesman problem}): every additional variable we add in can double the
    difficulty of finding a solution, so the time taken to solve a problem grows exponentially. In
    practice we can usually avoid this worst case by combining strong inference, symmetry breaking,
    carefully selected heuristics, and intelligent search, while learning from failure.  However,
    solving these problems can still take longer than we would like.

    \medskip

    Modern processors have at least two, and sometimes as many as fifteen, processing cores. We
    might hope that we could use these cores to make our programs \textbf{run faster}, or at least
    to \textbf{solve larger or harder problems} in the time we have.

    \medskip

    In general, we may do this by splitting problems up into evenly sized, independent pieces of work,
    which may be evaluated in parallel. However, combinatorial optimisation
    problems tend to be \textbf{highly irregular} (cannot be split into evenly sized pieces) and
    require \textbf{speculative parallelism} (the pieces have dependencies upon each other, and we
    must guess what the answer might be allow parallel evaluation).

    \medskip

    Despite this, results can be favourable. Our approach uses parallelism to explicitly
    \textbf{introduce diversity} into a search process to offset the weakest choices made by
    heuristics, so our parallel workers are reducing our commitment to potentially costly early
    mistakes. This is combined with late rebalancing, to give good work balance with low overheads
    and good scalability.
